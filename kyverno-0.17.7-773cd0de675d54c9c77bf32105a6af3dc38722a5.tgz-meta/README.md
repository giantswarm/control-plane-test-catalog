# kyverno

Kyverno is an admission controller offering policy enforcement as a validating or mutating webhook.
It audits or enforces policies for cluster resources, and produces reports about the compliance of the cluster.

It is used to enforce [Pod Security Standards (PSS)][pss-policies] as a replacement for Pod Security Policies (PSPs), as well as many other community-supported policies for various use cases. For more information on the switch from PSP to PSS, see [our blog post][pss-blog].

## Installing

There are 3 ways to install this app onto a workload cluster.

### Steps to update Kyverno charts

**Note:** There is automation in place to update both upstream fork and app charts on a monthly basis. However, you can manually trigger them if needed.

1. Make sure that [giantswarm/kyverno](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-upstream) is up to date and has the desired tag.

2. Trigger the [sync-from-upstream](https://github.com/giantswarm/kyverno-app/actions/workflows/sync-from-upstream.yaml) action from the `main` branch.

3. Review the PR generated by the actions bot.
