# Controllers

## Bucket controller

This controller reconciles `Buckets`. It creates a cloud provider bucket in the Management Cluster Region.
It currently only supports AWS S3 on CAPA management clusters and Azure Storage Container on CAPZ management clusters.

### CAPZ resources

To handle an object storage on Azure, we need to create:

- a storage account
- a storage container

We choose to create a unique relation Storage Account - Storage Container to have a proper clean up when a bucket is deleted. This way, there won't have orphan storage account on Azure.

We add a lifecyle management rule on the storage account to clean old data (`bucket.spec.expirationPolicy.days`)

When the object storage is created, we retrieve the Access Key and create a secret in the bucket namespace containing the name of the storage account and the access key. This secret is necessary for the application desiring to use this object storage.

By default, a reclaim policy is set to `reclaimPolicy: Retain` that means when a Bucket CR is deleted, nothing is done. The idea is to avoid accidental Bucket CR deletions that result in data loss on the Cloud provider.
However, if we need to clean up the bucket, we can set the reclaim policy to `reclaimPolicy: Delete`. This will remove all data on the Cloud provider.

# Testing

This project uses [`LocalStack`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) for integration tests. Remember that you can use the `aws` cli targetting the local [`LocalStack`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) environment with
```
$ aws --endpoint=http://localhost:4566 s3 list-buckets
```
