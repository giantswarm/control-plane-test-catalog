# cluster-api-provider-aws-app

Cluster API AWS controller (CAPA) packaged as a Giant Swarm app.

## Prerequisites

The CAPA controllers need access and permissions to create resources in the management cluster's AWS account. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites/tree/master/capa-controller-role) to set them up.

## Working with the fork

Please check the [README of Giant Swarm's CAPA fork](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-api-provider-aws). It explains the whole test and release process, and how to deal with upstream patches or hotfixes.
